# credit-risk-classification

Overview
This project aims to build a supervised learning model to predict the probability of a loan defaulting. The data used is from a peer-to-peer lending company.

Results

The logistic regression model had a precision of 80%, a recall of 70%, and an F1-score of 75%. The confusion matrix shows that the model performed well in classifying healthy loans, with only 20% false positives. However, the model performed slightly worse in classifying non-performing loans, with 30% false negatives.
